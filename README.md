# Infrastructure as Code
This project is a skeleton for infrastructure as code implementations. You can use it to quickly bootstrap your own infrastructure as code projects.

The seed contains a sample infrastructure as code implementation which includes,

- Terraform, CloudFormation, YAML and Python Scripts for infrastructure provisioning
- Puppet/Chef for configuration management 
- Docker for container management
- Fabric/Capistrano for remote execution and deployment
- Vagrant for local testing and development using Puppet/Chef solo
- Jenkins for continuous integration of infrastructure  
- A `hello world` example to provision and configure a Nodejs application

# Prerequisites
You need git to clone this seed repository. You can get git [here](http://git-scm.com/).

For the Puppet modules and Chef cookbooks, we are using [Git submodules](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule).
